step 1 open partition.cpp  , in int main , find " npart " change it to number of partitions we wanna make 2,4,6,8
then run :
g++ -o partition partition.cpp -lmetis
./partition

step2
mpicxx -fopenmp -o test hybrid.cpp

( change threads 2,4,6,8 ) and -np 2,4,6,8 ( according to the number of partitions we made in partition.cpp )
mpirun -np 2 ./f changes.txt 1




OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 mpirun -np 2 ./test changes.txt 0
